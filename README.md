# Lucky-Blue

Gambling app.

At the start of the game, we will have 2 minute counter. During that counter we can get tickets and choose our own 7 numbers. After the counter there'll be 5 second counter during which server will generate it's own combination.
After 7 rounds there'll be intermission after which we'll be sent to last window where we'll be shown tickets with most correct numbers (one or more tickets).

Application is simple. We used Vue, Vue.router and JS, with some HTML+CSS for looks.
Avoided using Vuex so we could show usage of $emit and props.
